Trading algorithm for prediction of price movement of 100 securities in a simulated market. 
Prediction is done with a Support Vector Classifier, and trading is done based on a mapping function (inverse tanh) where higher confidence/probability
is mapped to a greater trade size. 
Basically a mean-reversion strategy learned by SVC.

Note this is just the submission file so it is missing model testing/selection and data analysis which lead to the choice of features and model. 

This was some early trading work while I was still learning python/ML. If you are interested in my most recent trading/python work please look at my Trading folder in my repo.
