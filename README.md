# Jake Warby Coding/Project Work

Welcome to my github :). I have dumped a lot of my work from university work, project work and personal projects here. I have saved relevant code and presentation/papers in the relevant folders.

If you'd like to see some more of my work, I have a lot of typeset notes (written in R markdown) that I have uploaded on RPubs: https://rpubs.com/jwarby2000

If you have any questions or are interested please feel free to reach ut to me.
